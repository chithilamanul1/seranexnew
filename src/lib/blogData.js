      <p class="lead">Selecting a web design company in Colombo can be a challenge. How do you choose the right partner? It's about more than just a flashy portfolio. Here are five critical factors to consider.</p>
      <h2>1. Technical Expertise</h2>
      <p>Ensure your partner uses modern, high-performance technologies like Next.js. A beautiful website that is slow or insecure is a liability. Modern tech provides huge advantages in speed and security.</p>
      <h2>2. A Focus on Business Goals</h2>
      <p>The best agencies act as business consultants. They should be asking about your sales goals and target audience, not just colors and fonts. The website is a tool for growth.</p>
      <h2>3. A Transparent Process</h2>
      <p>A professional company will have a clear, step-by-step process they can explain to you, from initial design to final launch. This ensures your project stays on track and on budget.</p>
      <h2>4. A Strong Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Look for a proven track record of success. Their portfolio should show that they can handle projects of a similar scale and complexity to yours.</p>
      <h2>5. Value for Money</h2>
      <p>The cheapest option is rarely the best, but you should demand value. With modern technology, it's now possible to get a world-class website at a competitive Sri Lankan price. Don't overpay for outdated technology.</p>

This ensures the user experience is perfect on mobile, rather than being an afterthought.</p><h2>The Impact on SEO</h2><p>Google now uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it primarily looks at the mobile version of your site for ranking.
