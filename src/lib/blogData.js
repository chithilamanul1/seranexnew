      <p class="lead">Understanding the cost of a new website is one of the biggest challenges for any business owner in Sri Lanka. The price can range dramatically, from a few thousand rupees for a simple template to millions for a custom-built platform. This guide will break down the real costs and help you understand what you're paying for.</p>
      
      <h2>1. The Simple Brochure Website (LKR 50,000 - 150,000)</h2>
      <p>This is a basic, 3-5 page website perfect for showcasing your business. It typically includes a homepage, about page, services page, and a contact form. It's your digital business card.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What you get:</strong> A professional, mobile-responsive design based on a premium template, basic SEO setup, and a contact form.</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Small businesses, consultants, and anyone needing a professional online presence quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. The Business & E-Commerce Website (LKR 200,000 - 750,000+)</h2>
      <p>This is where things get serious. This type of website includes everything from the brochure site, plus advanced functionality like an online store, booking system, or custom features. The cost varies based on the complexity of the e-commerce setup and the number of products.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What you get:</strong> A custom design, full e-commerce functionality with payment gateway integration (PayHere, WEBXPAY), inventory management, and advanced SEO.</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Retail businesses, service providers with online booking, and companies looking to generate revenue directly from their website.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. The Custom Web Application (LKR 1,000,000 and up)</h2>
      <p>This is not just a website; it's a piece of custom software that runs in the browser. This could be an internal dashboard, a customer portal, or a unique platform idea. The cost is highly variable and depends entirely on the complexity of the features required.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What you get:</strong> A completely bespoke solution, engineered from the ground up to solve your specific business challenges. Includes dedicated backend, database, and API development.</li>
        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Startups, established enterprises, and businesses with unique operational needs that cannot be met by off-the-shelf software.</li>
      </ul>

    title: 'Choosing the Best Web Design Company in Colombo',
    description: 'The Colombo market is crowded. Here are 5 critical factors to consider when selecting a web design partner to ensure your project is a success.',

      <p class="lead">Selecting a web design company in Colombo can be overwhelming. With hundreds of options, how do you choose the right partner? It's about more than just a pretty portfolio. Here are five critical factors to consider.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Technical Expertise: Do They Use Modern Technology?</h2>
      <p>A beautiful website that is slow or insecure is useless. Ask potential partners what technology they use. Modern frameworks like Next.js (which we use at SERANEX) provide significant advantages in performance, security, and scalability compared to older platforms like WordPress.</p>

      <h2>2. A Strong Portfolio of Local & Global Work</h2>
      <p>Look for a company that has a proven track record. Their portfolio should showcase a range of projects, demonstrating their ability to handle different challenges. Do they have experience working with businesses in the Sri Lankan market?</p>

      <h2>3. A Clear, Transparent Process</h2>
      <p>A professional agency should be able to clearly explain their process, from the initial discovery and design phase to development, testing, and launch. If they can't explain their process, it's a major red flag.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Focus on Business Goals, Not Just Design</h2>
      <p>The best web design partners are business consultants first. They should ask you about your business goals, your target audience, and how the website will help you grow. The design should be a tool to achieve those goals, not just an art project.</p>

      <h2>5. Ongoing Support & Maintenance</h2>
      <p>A website is not a one-time project; it's a living asset. Ensure the company offers a clear plan for ongoing support, security updates, and maintenance. This is critical for the long-term health and success of your online presence.</p>
